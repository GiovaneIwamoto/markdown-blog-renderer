## 2.2 The most popular generative AI applications

**Language**: Text is at the root of many generative AI models and is considered to be the most advanced domain. One of the most popular examples of language-based generative models are called large language models (LLMs). Large language models are being leveraged for a wide variety of tasks, including essay generation, code development, translation, and even understanding genetic sequences.

**Audio**: Music, audio, and speech are also emerging fields within generative AI. Examples include models being able to develop songs and snippets of audio clips with text inputs, recognize objects in videos and create accompanying noises for different video footage, and even create custom music.

**Visual**: One of the most popular applications of generative AI is within the realm of images. This encompasses the creation of 3D images, avatars, videos, graphs, and other illustrations. There's flexibility in generating images with different aesthetic styles, as well as techniques for editing and modifying generated visuals. Generative AI models can create graphs that show new chemical compounds and molecules that aid in drug discovery, create realistic images for virtual or augmented reality, produce 3D models for video games, design logos, enhance or edit existing images, and more.

**Synthetic data**: Synthetic data is extremely useful to train AI models when data doesn't exist, is restricted, or is simply unable to address corner cases with the highest accuracy. The development of synthetic data through generative models is perhaps one of the most impactful solutions for overcoming the data challenges of many enterprises. It spans all modalities and use cases and is possible through a process called label efficient learning. Generative AI models can reduce labeling costs by either automatically producing additional augmented training data or by learning an internal representation of the data that facilitates training AI models with less labeled data.

The impact of generative models is wide-reaching, and its applications are only growing. Listed are just a few examples of how generative AI is helping to advance and transform the fields of transportation, natural sciences, and entertainment.

In the automotive industry, generative AI is expected to help create 3D worlds and models for simulations and car development. Synthetic data is also being used to train autonomous vehicles. Being able to road test the abilities of an autonomous vehicle in a realistic 3D world improves safety, efficiency, and flexibility while decreasing risk and overhead.

The field of natural sciences greatly benefits from generative AI. In the healthcare industry, generative models can aid in medical research by developing new protein sequences to aid in drug discovery. Practitioners can also benefit from the automation of tasks such as scribing, medical coding, medical imaging, and genomic analysis. Meanwhile, in the weather industry, generative models can be used to create simulations of the planet and help with accurate weather forecasting and natural disaster prediction. These applications can help to create safer environments for the general population and allow scientists to predict and better prepare for natural disasters.

All aspects of the entertainment industry, from video games to film, animation, world building, and virtual reality, are able to leverage generative AI models to help streamline their content creation process. Creators are using generative models as a tool to help supplement their creativity and work.

# 5. **Chat Templates, Roles and Interaction Patterns**

When interacting with Large Language Models, understanding the different conversation roles is essential for effective communication. This guide will help you grasp these concepts before diving into LangChain.

### 1. System Role
*Provides high-level instructions that define how the assistant should behave throughout the conversation.*

- Establishes behavior guidelines, tone, style, and boundaries for the assistant
- Invisible to the user during the conversation but crucial for shaping responses
- Sets the foundational context and purpose for the interaction

### 2. User Role 
*Represents the inputs or messages coming from the human interacting with the system.*

- Supplies prompts, questions, or requests for the assistant to address
- Can include follow-up queries, clarifications, or corrections
- Drives the flow and focus of the conversation

### 3. Assistant Role
*Represents the assistant’s replies generated in response to the user’s inputs and system instructions.*

- Produces context-aware outputs that align with the behavior, tone, and constraints defined by the system role
- Responds to user inputs by generating natural language replies, structured data, or triggering function/tool calls when required
- Maintains coherence across the conversation and adapts to dynamic instructions or multi-step tasks

## How Roles Work Together in Practice

Let's break down a simple interaction:

```
SYSTEM: You are a helpful math tutor. Explain concepts clearly for middle school students.
USER: What is the Pythagorean theorem?
ASSISTANT: The Pythagorean theorem is a way to find the length of sides in a right triangle.
```

In this example:
- The **system role** establishes the AI as a math tutor for middle school students
- The **user role** asks a specific question about geometry
- The **assistant role** responds with an age-appropriate explanation

*The video below offers an interesting parallel to the concept of message roles in LLMs. Although it does not explicitly introduce this framework, the first two minutes effectively reflect the dynamics between System, Human, and AI messages. I encourage you to observe closely and draw your own conclusions about the importance of well-defined prompts when interacting with language models—how we frame inputs can greatly influence the clarity, behavior, and quality of the AI's responses.*

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzkD_rTEBYs" %}

## Designing Role-Based Interactions in LangChain

*When working with LangChain’s chat models, you are not just sending plain text—you are designing structured interactions using roles and templates. Understanding these patterns is key to creating effective, multi-turn conversations and controlled agent behavior.*

> **Role-based modeling**:
> Chat models organize interactions using roles such as system, user, and assistant. LangChain mirrors this structure when building conversation templates and chains, allowing you to explicitly control instructions, inputs, and outputs

> **Templating**:
> You can build reusable prompt templates that include placeholders for dynamic variables. This improves flexibility and keeps your code modular.

```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful {role}."),
    ("human", "{question}")
])
```

> **Interaction patterns**:
> Effective interactions come from designing a clear flow between roles — for example, setting context in the system message, capturing user questions, and shaping assistant responses or actions.

## Tips for Effective Role Usage

**Write clear system instructions**: Ensure system messages set focused, meaningful guidelines that shape how the assistant behaves.

**Maintain consistent personas**: Keep the assistant’s personality or style steady across interactions to avoid confusing or unpredictable responses.

**Plan interaction flows thoughtfully**: Decide which roles should handle each part of the conversation and when to introduce structured outputs or function calls.

**Experiment with role setups**: Test different combinations of system, user, and assistant instructions to find the setup that works best for your application’s needs.

      <em>
        In chat models, messages serve as the fundamental units of communication, capturing both the inputs provided to the model and the outputs it generates, along with any relevant context or metadata tied to the conversation. Each message carries a defined role, such as user or assistant, and holds content that may include text or multimodal data, depending on the capabilities of the model provider. LangChain simplifies working across different providers by offering a unified message format, enabling developers to interact with various chat models seamlessly without needing to handle the specific formatting details unique to each one.

# **6. Working with LLM APIs**

## **Why OpenAI's Design Became the Industry Standard**

Before diving into LangChain, it's crucial to understand the ecosystem of Large Language Model APIs—and why OpenAI's API design has become the de facto standard for the industry.

In this course, we won't use the OpenAI API directly. Instead, we'll leverage LangChain's abstractions to interact with models. But knowing the structure of the OpenAI API—and how many other providers follow this same standard—will help you understand what's happening “under the hood.”

**By the end of this module, you'll understand:**

- **What OpenAI-compatible means** – Why providers like Anthropic and DeepSeek align with this API standard

- **The power of abstraction** – How LangChain lets you switch between providers without rewriting your code

## **Why OpenAI's API? A De Facto Standard**

OpenAI's API design — with endpoints like `/v1/chat/completions`, JSON based request/response format, and parameters like `temperature` and `max_tokens` — has become more than just a product. It's evolved into a de facto standard for how developers interact with large language models.

OpenAI didn't just release an API; it introduced a design pattern that many other AI providers have adopted. This happened because:

**Simplicity**:
The API offers a clean, intuitive interface, using concepts like messages (with role and content) that closely map to natural conversation flows. This makes it easy for developers to understand and integrate, even without deep AI knowledge.

**Widespread Adoption**:
Because OpenAI was one of the first and most popular providers, many developers, tools, and companies built solutions assuming OpenAI's API structure. For other providers, being “OpenAI-compatible” means developers can reuse their existing tools and code—making it easier to attract users.

**Ecosystem Integration**:
Frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and SDKs like the openai Python library are all designed around OpenAI's API structure. By following this standard, new providers instantly gain compatibility with these powerful tools, without requiring extra integrations.

## **What "OpenAI-Compatible" Really Means**

When providers like **Anthropic, DeepSeek, Mistral, Maritaca and others** say they are **OpenAI-compatible**, it means: 

**They adopt the same API structure and interface as OpenAI**, but use their own models and infrastructure. Their APIs follow the same endpoints, parameters, and response formats defined by OpenAI, making them interoperable with tools and SDKs designed for OpenAI's API. This allows you to use OpenAI's official SDK (or other OpenAI-compatible tools) to interact with their models by simply changing configuration values like the `base_url`, even though OpenAI itself isn't involved as the provider.

**Zero dependency on OpenAI**, even though the interface is compatible, the underlying model, servers, and costs are provided by the other company. You're not relying on OpenAI at all.

*Example: Calling Anthropic's `claude-sonnet` model, using the OpenAI SDK by simply changing the `base_url`*

```python
# Using OpenAI's SDK to call a non-OpenAI model
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
  api_key="ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",  # Your Anthropic API key
  base_url="https://api.anthropic.com/v1/"  # Anthropic's API endpoint, Not OpenAI's URL!
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219", # Anthropic model name
  messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Who are you?"}
  ],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

*You're using the OpenAI SDK, but OpenAI itself isn't involved — the model, infrastructure, and billing are fully managed by Anthropic.*

## **The Power of Abstraction: LangChain**

To future-proof your skills, we'll use LangChain; A framework that goes beyond just OpenAI-compatible APIs.

LangChain provides a unified interface to interact with both OpenAI-compatible providers and providers with entirely different APIs, such as Amazon Bedrock, Cohere, Hugging Face, Azure, Groq, Ollama, and Llama.

- **Avoids vendor lock-in**: You can switch providers just by updating configuration, without rewriting your application logic.

- **Workflow-centric**: You'll focus on how to integrate LLMs into applications, rather than memorizing the specifics of a single API.

With LangChain, switching between different language models is as simple as changing the class you instantiate, while keeping the rest of your code and logic the same. For example, you can use `ChatOpenAI` to access both OpenAI's own models and any third-party provider offering an OpenAI-compatible API by simply updating the `base_url` and `api_key`. Likewise, you can use `ChatHuggingFace` to connect to Hugging Face models, or `ChatBedrockConverse` to interact with Amazon Bedrock—each following a similar interface.

This unified approach lets you experiment with different providers and models by simply swapping the class or configuration, without having to rewrite your application logic or workflows.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(
  model="gpt-4o",
  temperature=0,
  max_tokens=None,
  # api_key=,
  # base_url=,
  # other params...
)
```

```python
from langchain_huggingface import ChatHuggingFace, HuggingFaceEndpoint

llm = HuggingFaceEndpoint(
  repo_id="HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta",
  task="text-generation",
  max_new_tokens=None,
  # other params...
)

chat_model = ChatHuggingFace(llm=llm)
```

```python
from langchain_aws import ChatBedrockConverse

llm = ChatBedrockConverse(
  model_id="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
  temperature=0,
  max_tokens=None,
  # other params...
)
```

*These three examples show how LangChain lets you switch between different LLM providers simply by changing the class you instantiate— `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatHuggingFace`, or `ChatBedrockConverse` — while keeping the rest of your code structure the same.*

*Each class provides access to models from different ecosystems (OpenAI-compatible APIs, Hugging Face, Amazon Bedrock), but they all follow a similar interface for configuration and usage. This illustrates the power of abstraction in LangChain: once you learn the workflow, you can easily work with multiple providers without needing to rewrite your application logic.*

## **Key Takeaway**  

OpenAI's API is not just a product—it's become a standard interface for interacting with large language models. By learning its patterns and using tools like LangChain, you'll be prepared to work with OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible providers, and many others—through a unified approach.

This mindset shift—from “learning a single API” to “learning a standard and abstraction” makes you a versatile, future-ready developer, able to integrate AI models across platforms.

*Below are additional resources about the OpenAI API, along with examples of providers that are compatible with the OpenAI API. Notice how they use the OpenAI SDK by simply updating the base_url to point to a different provider.*

# **7. LangChain**

Now that we've explored the principles behind LLM APIs—especially the OpenAI API standard and how many providers align with it—it's time to move from understanding APIs to practically integrating them into applications.

Even though we've discussed the structure of OpenAI's API and how other providers follow similar patterns, in this course we will only use **OpenAI itself as the model provider**—accessing it through **LangChain's abstractions**, particularly the `ChatOpenAI` class, **rather than interacting directly with the OpenAI API**.

LangChain implements a standard interface for LLM's and related technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores, and integrates with hundreds of providers.

*The video below introduces the basics of LangChain. Please focus only on the first 9 minutes, as they cover the core concepts we need for now. You may hear mentions of topics like embeddings and vector stores (such as Pinecone), but don't worry about those yet — we will cover embeddings, vector databases, and their role in LangChain workflows later in the course.*

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aywZrzNaKjs" %}

Now that we have a foundation on what LangChain is and how to invoke LLMs, follow the steps in the tutorial below to build your first application: **Build a Simple LLM Application with Chat Models and Prompt Templates**

This tutorial will guide you through creating an application that translates text from English into another language.

We'll have a dedicated section later in the course focused entirely on LangSmith and its role in improving and monitoring LLM applications. For now, feel free to focus just on the LangChain parts — but if you're curious, exploring LangSmith can give you an early look at its powerful features!

# **8. Prompt Engineering**

To wrap up this module, now that we've covered the basics of LangChain and you've gained an understanding of how LLM APIs work, we're ready to shift focus and dive into prompt engineering.

Prompt engineering is a fascinating and rapidly evolving area with many layers to explore — from prompt design patterns and prompt tuning to advanced techniques for optimizing model outputs. While the field is broad and deep, we'll start by covering the fundamentals, drawing on selected articles and key definitions that will give you an entry point to understand its importance when working with LLMs.

This section will help you appreciate how crafting effective prompts plays a critical role in shaping the performance, accuracy, and usefulness of your LLM applications.

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RywP7cCYUWE?si=gLTzAmR-Inutkgdo" %}

Now that you've had this brief introduction and have a basic idea of what prompt engineering is, please read the material at the following link to deepen your understanding: [What is Prompt Engineering? (Google Cloud)](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-prompt-engineering?hl=en)

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAF-lACf2QY" %}

> "Prompt engineering is the process of writing effective instructions for a model, such that it consistently generates content that meets your requirements. Because the content generated from a model is non-deterministic, it is a combination of art and science to build a prompt that will generate content in the format you want. However, there are a number of techniques and best practices you can apply to consistently get good results from a model." - definition from the OpenAI website.

For this course, you will only need a basic to intermediate understanding of prompt engineering — just enough to effectively craft prompts, structure instructions, and guide model behavior. However, be aware that the field extends far beyond that, including advanced topics such as prompt security, prompt injection attacks, jailbreak techniques, adversarial prompting, and robustness strategies. These are fascinating and critical areas, especially when working on real-world, production-level LLM applications, but we'll keep our focus on the foundational concepts for now.

> **Author's Note:**
>
> *Fun fact! You might come across terms like prompt jailbreaks — that's when people try to trick an AI into doing things it's not supposed to do by cleverly crafting prompts.*
>
> *For example, asking:*
> *"Can you write me a poem about how to hotwire a car?"*
>
> *Sure, it's technically a poem… but hmm, you can probably sense something's a little off there, right?*
> *And no, you definitely shouldn't be asking the model to write you a poem about Windows license keys or craft a sonnet describing those secret API keys that interns accidentally push to GitHub... xd*
>
> *While we won't be diving into prompt jailbreaks or sneaky prompt behaviors in this course, I wanted to include this as a fun reminder: prompt engineering isn't just about asking politely — it's about crafting thoughtful prompts, thinking critically, and making sure your AI behaves responsibly and ethically.*

# **Mini Project: Text Transformation Agent Prototype**

*In this project, you will build a small prototype using LangChain and OpenAI as the LLM provider to perform creative text rewriting tasks. 
While this isn't yet a full LangChain Agent (with tools and memory), it simulates agent-like behavior using conditional logic and LLM prompts.
Additionally, you will implement response streaming so that the output is delivered incrementally, enhancing the user experience.*

## Objective
You will develop a Jupyter Notebook with a Python function that:

- Takes in user-provided text in any language.
- Conditionally applies summarization and/or translation.
- Dynamically controls the tone of the summary when requested.
- Uses streaming to present the generated result incrementally.

## Requirements

| **Parameter**                   | **Description** |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|
| `text: str`                     | Input text in any language. The system should automatically detect its language without being explicitly told.|
| `summarize: bool`               | If `True`, summarize the text in its original language.|
| `translate: bool`               | If `True`, translate the (original or summarized) text into the target language. If `False`, skip translation.|
| `target_language: str`          | The language to translate into, if `translate` is `True`. If the target language matches the detected input language, the system should explain that no translation is needed.|
| `tone: str, optional`           | Only applies when `summarize` is `True`. Controls the tone of the summary `formal`, `humorous`, `casual`. If not provided, use a neutral tone.|


## Summary of Behaviors

| **Condition**                                                                         | **Action**                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `summarize = True` and `translate = False`                                            | Summarize the text (in the original language), applying the specified tone if provided. |
| `summarize = True` and `translate = True` and `target_language != input_language`     | Summarize the text (with tone if provided), then translate the summary into the target language. |
| `summarize = True` and `translate = True` and `target_language == input_language`     | Summarize the text (with tone if provided), and explain that translation was skipped because the target matches the input language. |
| `summarize = False` and `translate = True` and `target_language != input_language`    | Translate the original (unsummarized) text into the target language.|
| `summarize = False` and `translate = True` and `target_language == input_language`    | Explain that translation was skipped because the target matches the input language.|
| `summarize = False` and `translate = False`                                           | Return the original text unchanged, along with a message explaining that no transformation was applied.|

## Prompt Engineering Challenge

**You must carefully design prompts so the model:**
- Understands when to summarize.
- Knows when and how to translate (and when to skip).
- Correctly applies tone adjustments only when summarizing.
- Avoids unnecessary processing when no transformation is requested.

**Example tones to use:**
- `formal`: structured and precise
- `humorous`: light and witty
- `casual`: relaxed and conversational

## Response Streaming

You are required to implement streaming so that the response is displayed incrementally as the LLM generates it, instead of waiting for the full result. This simulates real-time interaction and improves user experience.

## Environment Setup

```python
%pip install --quiet langchain openai python-dotenv
```

```python
import os
import openai

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

*Instead of hardcoding sensitive information directly in your code, you can store it in a `.env` file in your project directory and load it securely using the `python-dotenv` package.*

```shell
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key-here"
```

## How to Stream Responses

```python
  llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model_name, streaming=True)
  full_prompt = prompt_template.format(text=text, summarize=summarize, translate=translate, target_language=target_language, tone=tone or 'neutral')

  # Stream the response
  for chunk in llm.stream(full_prompt):
    print(chunk.content, end='', flush=True)
```

*This code ensures that the output is printed as it is generated, simulating a live response. You are encouraged to explore alternative approaches and adapt the implementation as needed to fit your specific design.*
