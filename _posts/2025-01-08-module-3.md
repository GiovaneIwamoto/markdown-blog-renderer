title: "Module 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation"
layout: post
---

In this module, we'll explore how language models can be enhanced by connecting them to external sources of information—a technique known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While LLMs are powerful, they're limited to the data they were trained on. RAG allows the model to retrieve external content in real time and use it as context for generating more accurate and relevant responses.

To build a RAG system, we'll cover the full pipeline: loading data from various sources, splitting long texts into chunks, embedding the content into vectors, storing it in vector databases, retrieving the most relevant pieces during a query, and finally using that retrieved information to generate informed answers.

Before we begin exploring each topic individually, here's a brief overview of the core components involved in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow. Each step plays a crucial role in enabling language models to retrieve and use external information effectively:

* **Document Loaders**: Responsible for bringing external data into the system. They support a wide variety of formats such as PDFs, web pages, databases, and cloud files, acting as the entry point to your knowledge base.

* **Text Splitters**: Once documents are loaded, they are broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This helps ensure that information remains coherent and accessible during processing and retrieval.

* **Text Embedding Models**: These models convert chunks of text into numerical vectors that capture the meaning and context of the content. This transformation enables semantic search, where similar concepts are positioned closely in vector space.

* **Vector Stores**: Specialized databases that store and organize text embeddings. They allow for fast and meaningful retrieval of content and are compatible with in-memory setups or scalable cloud-based solutions.

* **Retrievers**: Tools that search the vector store to find the most relevant pieces of information based on a user query. Different types of retrievers exist, from simple semantic matchers to more advanced ones like self-query retrievers or ensemble approaches that combine multiple strategies.

* **Generation**: Finally, the language model takes the retrieved context and uses it to generate responses that are more accurate, grounded, and relevant to the query.

*The video below offers a high-level overview of the key topics we'll be working on in this module. It serves as a helpful preview of what's to come, and each component will be explored individually and in more depth as we move forward.*

# **1. Document Loaders**

Document Loaders are responsible for bringing external content—like CSVs, PDFs, web pages, and databases—into your application in a format that LangChain can work with. Regardless of the source, all loaders return data in a unified structure called a `Document`, which includes both the content and relevant metadata.

Each type of loader is designed to handle a specific format or data source, and while their configuration parameters vary depending on the integration, they all share a common interface: you initialize the loader and call its `.load()` method to extract the data.

```python
# Load CSV file
from langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader import CSVLoader

loader = CSVLoader( 
    ...  # Your custom parameters here
)
documents = loader.load()
```

```python
# Load PDF file
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

file_path = "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path)

documents = loader.load()
```

# **2. Text Splitters**

Text splitters are utilities that break a large document into smaller chunks of text. In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, this step is crucial: it transforms long knowledge sources into bite-sized pieces that can be embedded and retrieved efficiently. Large Language Models have a limited context window, meaning they cannot consume extremely long texts all at once.

By splitting a document into chunks that fit the context window, we ensure the LLM can later ingest relevant pieces. This process (often called chunking) is fundamental to RAG – after splitting, each chunk can be vectorized (embedded) and stored, so that given a query, only the most relevant chunks are retrieved for the model to generate an answer. 

In short, text splitters bridge the gap between dense source data and LLM input limits, enabling applications like question answering over documents.

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Io43kf0hYn4" %}

Another reason text splitters are important is semantic coherence. Ideally, we want each chunk to contain a self-contained, semantically meaningful piece of information. 

If we naively split text at fixed lengths, we might cut off sentences or separate closely related context. Good text splitting keeps related pieces of text together – for example, a paragraph or a section of a document should remain in one chunk if possible. Maintaining this coherence improves the quality of downstream embeddings and results, since each chunk will represent a complete thought or topic.

### How Text Splitters Work in LangChain

LangChain provides built-in text splitter classes that implement common chunking strategies. Under the hood, the chunking process can be summarized in three steps:

**Initial Split** – Break the text into small units (e.g. sentences or paragraphs) using a separator or delimiter. This yields many small pieces that are semantically meaningful (for example, splitting on sentence boundaries).

**Chunk Assembly** – Gradually combine those small pieces into a larger chunk until a certain size limit is reached (the chunk size). This forms a chunk that is under or around the desired maximum length.

**Overlap and Next Chunk** – Once a chunk reaches the size limit, finalize it and start a new chunk. Optionally include some overlap with the previous chunk (repeating the last few tokens/words) to preserve context continuity between chunks. This overlap helps to avoid cutting important information that straddles a boundary.

This chunking approach aims to produce text segments that are constrained in size while still preserving the natural structure of the original content. Instead of arbitrarily cutting text at fixed lengths—which can disrupt meaning or break sentences—this method prioritizes splitting at logical boundaries such as paragraphs or sentences. 

There are two important aspects you can configure to fine-tune how chunking behaves. First, how the text is split: this could be based on characters, words, sentences, or specific delimiters like newlines or paragraph breaks. Choosing the right splitting method helps maintain the coherence of each chunk. Second, how the chunk size is measured: chunk limits can be defined by the number of characters, the number of tokens (which is especially relevant for language models), or even by higher-level semantic units. 

By thoughtfully adjusting these two factors, you can ensure that each chunk remains meaningful, balanced in size, and well-suited for downstream tasks like embedding or retrieval.

# **3. Embedding Models**

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vlcQV4j2kTo" %}

**Text embeddings** are numerical representations that capture the meaning and context of a piece of text within a high-dimensional vector space. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on matching exact words, embeddings allow machines to evaluate the *semantic similarity* between texts — understanding what the text *means*, not just what it *says*.

This capability begins with **text vectorization**, the process of converting text into a numerical format that models can work with. While early techniques like one-hot encoding or bag-of-words count word occurrences, they fall short in capturing relationships between words or the context in which they appear. Modern embedding models overcome this limitation by learning to position semantically similar texts closer together in a shared vector space. This allows for more intelligent and flexible comparisons across different pieces of text.

Embeddings have become essential in many NLP applications, including **semantic search**, recommendation systems, clustering, and classification. By using similarity metrics such as cosine similarity, systems can quantitatively assess how closely two texts are related in meaning — a core feature for making language-based applications more accurate and adaptive.

OpenAI offers state-of-the-art embedding models that generate high-dimensional, fixed-length vectors capable of representing complex textual meaning. These models can be easily integrated into applications using LangChain, which provides convenient tools for embedding generation, storage in vector databases, and semantic retrieval.

This leads us to a critical application of embeddings in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. In a RAG pipeline, when a user submits a query, it is first embedded into a vector. This query vector is then compared against a pre-indexed set of document embeddings stored in a vector database. Instead of relying on exact keyword matches, the system retrieves documents whose semantic meaning closely aligns with the user's input — even if the words used are different.

These retrieved documents are then provided as context to the language model, enabling it to generate more accurate, relevant, and grounded responses. The quality of the final answer depends heavily on the *retrieval step*, and by extension, on the quality of the embeddings used.

In summary, embeddings are not just useful for comparing texts — they are foundational in enabling retrieval-based architectures like RAG to operate effectively. By serving as the bridge between a user's intent and the relevant knowledge available, embeddings ensure that generative AI systems respond with precision, relevance, and contextual understanding.

*Here is an example using LangChain together with an embedding model from OpenAI to generate vector representations of text.*

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for OpenAI: ")

from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")

embeddings = embeddings_model.embed_documents(
    ["At Dandilyonn, we strongly believe in the statement Earth is Worth it: that the Earth is worth saving, and we will stop at nothing to ensure that our community is a clean energy, green machine. Our mission is to educate youth about climate change, promote green habits, and raise money for community projects beneficial to the environment.",]
)
len(embeddings), len(embeddings[0])

# Output

embedded_query = embeddings_model.embed_query("What is SEEDS and what is its main purpose?")
embedded_query[:6]

</div>

A vector database is a specialized database designed for storing and searching these high-dimensional embedding vectors. It indexes and stores vector embeddings and allows fast retrieval based on similarity search, rather than exact matching. In fact, the terms vector database, vector store, or vector search engine often refer to the same idea – a system that can store vectors (fixed-length lists of numbers) and query them by similarity. Unlike traditional databases that excel at exact matches and structured queries (like finding a record by an ID or filtering by a field value), a vector database is built to answer questions like “*Which stored vectors are most similar to my query vector?*”. It typically implements nearest neighbor search algorithms under the hood. This means you can give it a new vector (for example, an embedding of a user's question) and it will quickly return the stored items whose embeddings are closest to that vector – i.e., the most semantically relevant items.

Importantly, a vector database isn't just a raw index; it usually provides all the standard database features needed to manage the data. A good vector database supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), can store metadata alongside each vector (like an ID or tags for the original text), allows filtering results by metadata, and can scale to handle large amounts of data efficiently. In essence, it combines the ability to do similarity searches on vectors with the reliability and management features of a database.

### Why not use a regular database? 

Traditional relational databases or key-value stores are not optimized for the kind of similarity matching we need with embeddings. You could store vectors in them, but searching for “the closest vector” would be extremely slow without specialized indexes. As embeddings have hundreds or thousands of dimensions, doing a naive search is computationally heavy. Traditional databases are built for exact matches or simple numeric comparisons, not for high-dimensional geometry. This is why we need a specialized system: vector databases are designed to handle the complexity and scale of embedding data that would overwhelm a normal database. They use advanced indexing techniques (like approximate nearest neighbor algorithms) to make similarity search fast, even over millions of vectors.

### Vector Search in Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Now that we know about embeddings and vector databases, let's see why they are so important in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG is a technique used with large language models (LLMs) where the model's knowledge is “augmented” by retrieving relevant information from outside sources (like a set of documents) and feeding that information into the model to help generate the answer. This is extremely useful when you want an AI to answer questions using a specific collection of text (for example, company documents or a knowledge base) that the AI wasn't originally trained on, or when you want up-to-date information. In a RAG workflow, when a user asks a question, the system doesn't rely solely on the AI model's internal knowledge. Instead, it retrieves relevant text from an external data store (your documents) and augments the model's input with that text. The model then generates a response using both its own learned knowledge and the provided relevant information. Here's how vector databases make this possible:

**Convert Text to Vectors (Indexing)**: First, all the documents (or chunks of documents) in your knowledge base are converted into embedding vectors using an embedding model. These vectors are stored in a vector database, and each vector is associated with the original text it came from (so we can retrieve the text later). This is usually done ahead of time as a preparation step.

> Note: Everything we've covered so far—generating embeddings from text, storing those embeddings in a vector database, and preparing them for future search—falls under the process known as **indexing**. Indexing involves taking your raw text data, converting it into vector embeddings, and organizing those vectors in a way that makes them easy to retrieve later using similarity search.

**Convert Query to Vector (Retrieval)**: When a user asks a question (the query), that question is also converted into a vector using the same embedding model. Now we have a query vector representing the meaning of the question.

**Similarity Search in the Vector Database**: The query's embedding is used to search the vector database for the closest vectors among those stored. In other words, the system finds which documents in the database are most “similar” in meaning to the query, by finding vectors nearest to the query vector. This is the vector search step – the core of why we built the vector database. The result of this search is a handful of top-matching documents (the ones whose embeddings are most similar to the query's embedding). The vector database typically returns either the stored text passages directly or identifiers that let us fetch those passages.

**Augment and Generate Answer**: The retrieved text snippets are then passed along with the original question to the language model. The LLM now has some relevant context to draw from, which significantly improves its ability to produce an accurate and specific answer. Finally, the LLM generates the answer, hopefully using the information from those snippets to be correct and detailed
