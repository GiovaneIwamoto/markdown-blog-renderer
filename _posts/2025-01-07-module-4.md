title: "Module 4: RAG - Retrieval and Generation: Enhancing Language Models with Context-Aware Retrieval and Generation"
layout: post
--- 

In this module, we dive into the second core stage of the RAG pipeline: Retrieval and Generation. This is where things start to come together — we'll retrieve relevant chunks of information from our vector database and use them to generate accurate, context-aware responses through language models. By the end of this module, you'll be able to implement a fully functional RAG flow that brings your documents to life with intelligent answers.


In the previous module, we focused on the indexing process, laying the groundwork by exploring key components such as Document Loaders, Text Splitters, Embedding Models, and Vector Stores. Now, it’s time to leverage all that structure to build an end-to-end RAG solution.
