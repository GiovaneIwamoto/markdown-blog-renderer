title: "Module 3: RAG - Indexing: Document Loaders, Text Splitters, Embedding Models, Vector Stores"
layout: post
--- 

In this module, we’ll focus specifically on the indexing phase of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Indexing is the foundation of any RAG pipeline, involving the transformation of raw text into vector embeddings and storing them in a way that enables efficient retrieval later. While this step doesn’t generate responses yet, it is essential for preparing the knowledge base that language models will use.


We’ll introduce the overall concept of RAG and briefly explain how it connects the retrieve and generate steps to large language models (LLMs). However, the full implementation and development of retrieval strategies and answer generation will be covered in the next module, where we’ll go deeper into how those components interact with the index we build here.

To build a RAG system, we'll cover the full pipeline: loading data from various sources, splitting long texts into chunks, embedding the content into vectors, storing it in vector databases, retrieving the most relevant pieces during a query, and finally using that retrieved information to generate informed answers.

*Before we begin exploring each topic individually, here's a brief overview of the core components involved in the RAG workflow. Each step plays a crucial role in enabling language models to retrieve and use external information effectively:*

* **Document Loaders**: Responsible for bringing external data into the system. They support a wide variety of formats such as PDFs, web pages, databases, and cloud files, acting as the entry point to your knowledge base.

* **Text Splitters**: Once documents are loaded, they are broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This helps ensure that information remains coherent and accessible during processing and retrieval.

* **Text Embedding Models**: These models convert chunks of text into numerical vectors that capture the meaning and context of the content. This transformation enables semantic search, where similar concepts are positioned closely in vector space.

* **Vector Stores**: Specialized databases that store and organize text embeddings. They allow for fast and meaningful retrieval of content and are compatible with in-memory setups or scalable cloud-based solutions.

> *Note: In this module, we'll focus on these indexing steps. The next module will explore in depth how retrieval and generation work together to produce accurate, context-aware responses.*

* **Retrievers**: Tools that search the vector store to find the most relevant pieces of information based on a user query. Different types of retrievers exist, from simple semantic matchers to more advanced ones like self-query retrievers or ensemble approaches that combine multiple strategies.

* **Generation**: Finally, the language model takes the retrieved context and uses it to generate responses that are more accurate, grounded, and relevant to the query.

*The video below offers a high-level overview of the key topics we'll be working on in this module. It serves as a helpful preview of what's to come, and each component will be explored individually and in more depth as we move forward.*

# **1. Document Loaders**

Document Loaders are responsible for bringing external content—like CSVs, PDFs, web pages, and databases—into your application in a format that LangChain can work with. Regardless of the source, all loaders return data in a unified structure called a `Document`, which includes both the content and relevant metadata.

Each type of loader is designed to handle a specific format or data source, and while their configuration parameters vary depending on the integration, they all share a common interface: you initialize the loader and call its `.load()` method to extract the data.

```python
# Load CSV file
from langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader import CSVLoader

loader = CSVLoader( 
    ...  # Your custom parameters here
)
documents = loader.load()
```

```python
# Load PDF file
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

file_path = "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path)

documents = loader.load()
```

# **2. Text Splitters**

Text splitters are utilities that break a large document into smaller chunks of text. In a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline, this step is crucial: it transforms long knowledge sources into bite-sized pieces that can be embedded and retrieved efficiently. Large Language Models have a limited context window, meaning they cannot consume extremely long texts all at once.

By splitting a document into chunks that fit the context window, we ensure the LLM can later ingest relevant pieces. This process, commonly referred to as **chunking**, is fundamental to RAG. After splitting, each chunk is vectorized and stored so that, when a query is made, only the most relevant chunks are retrieved for the model to generate a response.

In short, text splitters bridge the gap between dense source data and LLM input limits, enabling applications like question answering over documents.

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Io43kf0hYn4" %}

Another reason text splitters are important is semantic coherence. Ideally, we want each chunk to contain a self-contained, semantically meaningful piece of information. 

If we naively split text at fixed lengths, we might cut off sentences or separate closely related context. Good text splitting keeps related pieces of text together – for example, a paragraph or a section of a document should remain in one chunk if possible. Maintaining this coherence improves the quality of downstream embeddings and results, since each chunk will represent a complete thought or topic.

## How Text Splitters Work in LangChain

LangChain provides built-in text splitter classes that implement common chunking strategies. Under the hood, the chunking process can be summarized in three steps:

**Initial Split** – Break the text into small units (e.g. sentences or paragraphs) using a separator or delimiter. This yields many small pieces that are semantically meaningful (for example, splitting on sentence boundaries).

**Chunk Assembly** – Gradually combine those small pieces into a larger chunk until a certain size limit is reached (the chunk size). This forms a chunk that is under or around the desired maximum length.

**Overlap and Next Chunk** – Once a chunk reaches the size limit, finalize it and start a new chunk. Optionally include some overlap with the previous chunk (repeating the last few tokens/words) to preserve context continuity between chunks. This overlap helps to avoid cutting important information that straddles a boundary.

This chunking approach aims to produce text segments that are constrained in size while still preserving the natural structure of the original content. Instead of arbitrarily cutting text at fixed lengths—which can disrupt meaning or break sentences—this method prioritizes splitting at logical boundaries such as paragraphs or sentences. 

There are two important aspects you can configure to fine-tune how chunking behaves. First, how the text is split: this could be based on characters, words, sentences, or specific delimiters like newlines or paragraph breaks. Choosing the right splitting method helps maintain the coherence of each chunk. Second, how the chunk size is measured: chunk limits can be defined by the number of characters, the number of tokens (which is especially relevant for language models), or even by higher-level semantic units. 

By thoughtfully adjusting these two factors, you can ensure that each chunk remains meaningful, balanced in size, and well-suited for downstream tasks like embedding or retrieval.

# **3. Embedding Models**

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vlcQV4j2kTo" %}

**Text embeddings** are numerical representations that capture the meaning and context of a piece of text within a high-dimensional vector space. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on matching exact words, embeddings allow machines to evaluate the *semantic similarity* between texts — understanding what the text *means*, not just what it *says*.

This capability begins with **text vectorization**, the process of converting text into a numerical format that models can work with. While early techniques like *one-hot encoding* or *bag-of-words* count word occurrences, they fall short in capturing relationships between words or the context in which they appear. Modern embedding models overcome this limitation by learning to position semantically similar texts closer together in a shared vector space. This allows for more intelligent and flexible comparisons across different pieces of text.

Embeddings have become essential in many NLP applications, including **semantic search**, recommendation systems, clustering, and classification. By using similarity metrics such as **cosine similarity**, systems can quantitatively assess how closely two texts are related in meaning — a core feature for making language-based applications more accurate and adaptive.

OpenAI offers state-of-the-art embedding models that generate high-dimensional, fixed-length vectors capable of representing complex textual meaning. These models can be easily integrated into applications using LangChain, which provides convenient tools for embedding generation, storage in vector databases, and semantic retrieval.

This leads us to a critical application of embeddings in Retrieval-Augmented Generation. In a RAG pipeline, when a user submits a query, it is first embedded into a vector. This query vector is then compared against a pre-indexed set of document embeddings stored in a vector database. Instead of relying on exact keyword matches, the system retrieves documents whose semantic meaning closely aligns with the user's input — even if the words used are different.

These retrieved documents are then provided as context to the language model, enabling it to **generate** more accurate, relevant, and grounded responses. The quality of the final answer depends heavily on the **retrieval** step, and by extension, on the quality of the embeddings used.

In summary, embeddings are not just useful for comparing texts — they are foundational in enabling retrieval-based architectures like RAG to operate effectively. By serving as the bridge between a user's intent and the relevant knowledge available, embeddings ensure that generative AI systems respond with precision, relevance, and contextual understanding.

*Here is an example using LangChain together with an embedding model from OpenAI to generate vector representations of text.*

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for OpenAI: ")

from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")

embeddings = embeddings_model.embed_documents(
    ["At Dandilyonn, we strongly believe in the statement Earth is Worth it: that the Earth is worth saving, and we will stop at nothing to ensure that our community is a clean energy, green machine. Our mission is to educate youth about climate change, promote green habits, and raise money for community projects beneficial to the environment.",]
)
len(embeddings), len(embeddings[0])
```

```python
# Output

```

```python
embedded_query = embeddings_model.embed_query("What is SEEDS and what is its main purpose?")
embedded_query[:6]
```

```python

  </iframe>

</div>

A **vector database** is a specialized database designed for storing and searching these high-dimensional embedding vectors. It indexes and stores vector embeddings and allows fast retrieval based on **similarity search**, rather than exact matching. In fact, the terms vector database, vector store, or vector search engine often refer to the same idea – a system that can store vectors (fixed-length lists of numbers) and query them by similarity. Unlike traditional databases that excel at exact matches and structured queries (like finding a record by an ID or filtering by a field value), a vector database is built to answer questions like “*Which stored vectors are most similar to my query vector?*”. It typically implements nearest neighbor search algorithms under the hood. This means you can give it a new vector (for example, an embedding of a user's question) and it will quickly return the stored items whose embeddings are closest to that vector – i.e., the most semantically relevant items.

Importantly, a vector database isn't just a raw index; it usually provides all the standard database features needed to manage the data. A good vector database supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), can store metadata alongside each vector (like an ID or tags for the original text), allows filtering results by metadata, and can scale to handle large amounts of data efficiently. In essence, it combines the ability to do similarity searches on vectors with the reliability and management features of a database.

## Limitations of Traditional Databases for Vector Search

Traditional relational databases or key-value stores are not optimized for the kind of similarity matching we need with embeddings. You could store vectors in them, but searching for "the closest vector" would be extremely slow without specialized indexes. As embeddings have hundreds or thousands of dimensions, doing a naive search is computationally heavy. Traditional databases are built for exact matches or simple numeric comparisons, not for high-dimensional geometry. This is why we need a specialized system: vector databases are designed to handle the complexity and scale of embedding data that would overwhelm a normal database. They use advanced indexing techniques (like approximate nearest neighbor algorithms) to make similarity search fast, even over millions of vectors.

## How Vector Databases Power Semantic Retrieval

Now that we understand embeddings and how they represent the meaning of text, it's important to see how vector databases enable efficient semantic search—especially in applications where an AI system needs to respond based on external content.

Instead of relying solely on a model’s pre-trained knowledge, we can give it access to relevant documents through a process that involves retrieving information and using it to generate more accurate responses. The vector database plays a central role in making this possible by storing embeddings and allowing fast similarity-based retrieval.

Here’s how the process works:

* **Indexing (Prepare the Knowledge Base)**: All documents are split into smaller chunks, embedded using a model, and stored in a vector database. Each vector is linked to its original text so it can be retrieved later when relevant.

> *Note: This indexing step is everything we’ve done so far: transforming raw text into embeddings and storing them in a structure optimized for semantic search.*

* **Query Encoding (Understand the Input)**: When the user provides an input—such as a prompt, instruction, or search query—the system converts it into an embedding using the same model used during indexing.

* **Similarity Search (Retrieve Relevant Information)**: The vector database compares the query vector with the stored ones and returns the closest matches—those that are most similar in meaning.

* **Answer Generation (Use Retrieved Context)**: The retrieved text chunks are sent to the language model alongside the query, providing the context it needs to generate a well-informed answer.

## Pinecone within Langchain

This example demonstrates how to use OpenAI's embedding model and integrate it with Pinecone for vector storage using the LangChain framework. First, the OpenAI API key is securely loaded and used to initialize the OpenAIEmbeddings class with the `text-embedding-3-large` model, which is designed to generate high-quality vector representations of text. Then, the `PineconeVectorStore` is instantiated by providing the embeddings and a reference to a Pinecone index, which is created using your Pinecone API key and index name. This setup allows you to store and retrieve vectorized documents efficiently.

```python
pip install -qU langchain-openai
```

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter API key for OpenAI: ")

from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")
```

```python
pip install -qU langchain-pinecone  
```

```python
from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore
from pinecone import Pinecone

pc = Pinecone(api_key=...)
index = pc.Index(index_name)

vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(embedding=embeddings, index=index)
```

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h0D7QOs4dKU" %}

When using a vector database like Pinecone, it is essential that the **dimension of the embedding vectors** matches the dimension expected by the database index. For example, OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small` model produces vectors of length 1536 by default, while `text-embedding-3-large` outputs vectors with 3072 dimensions. When you create an index in Pinecone, you must specify the embedding dimension it will store. If there’s a mismatch—such as trying to insert a 3072-dimensional vector into a 1536-dimensional index—Pinecone will raise an error. Therefore, always ensure that the embedding model you choose and the index configuration in Pinecone are aligned, so the system can store and retrieve vectors accurately and efficiently.
